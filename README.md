# Professional README Generator
  ## User Story:
  As a developer, I want a README generator, so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
  ## Acceptance Criteria:
  Given a command-line application that accepts user input, when I am prompted for information about my application repository, then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When I enter my project title, then this is displayed as the title of the README. When I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, then this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests. When I choose a license for my application from a list of options, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under. When I enter my GitHub username, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile. When I enter my email address, then this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions. When I click on the links in the Table of Contents, then I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.
